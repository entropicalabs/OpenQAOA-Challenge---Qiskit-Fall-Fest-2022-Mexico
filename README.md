# Welcome to Entropica Labs Challenge!

Every Algorithm has a Beginning!

The success of a QAOA depends, among many factors, on the choice of initial parameters. Choose poorly, and training will be lengthy and complex. Choose wisely, and you may stand a chance to see the QAOA succeed!

## The tasks

Finding good initial parameters for the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm is very complex. In this task, you'll have a go at this problem!

Don't worry too much about the solution: the goal is for you to have fun discovering QAOA and trying to think about how to improve quantum optimisation through classical methods.

## Getting started

First, you will need to install OpenQAOA. The simplest way to do that is

1. In a new environment, install OpenQAOA. It is simple; you just need to run `pip install openqaoa` :)

(if you face issues with the instal, give us a shout! Most likely, you can fix most errors by simply creating a new environment running on python3.8: follow [this](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) tutorial from Conda and then install openqaoa via `pip` )

2. Now that you are set, you can start exploring OpenQAOA. To get started, you can:
    1. Check out OpenQAOA's official documentation: - [Run your first OpenQAOA workflow](https://el-openqaoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/1_workflows_example.html)
    2. Check out the intro notebooks such as [OpenQAOA_tutorial.ipynb](./OpenQAOA_tutorial.ipynb) that have been created especially for this challenge
    3. Go to the [challenge notebook](./Challenge_notebook.ipynb)!

## Have fun!

And remember, OpenQAOA is an opensource package, and as such, we always look for new collaborators :)
